# Min Max Dice Roller

## Description
A simple dice roller function that lets you set the minimum and maximum values of the die rolled. I use it fairly frequently and keeping it here seemed like an idea.

## How to Use
Drop the function into your code, call it while supplying the minimum and maximum values for your die, and use the returned value (of the rolled die) as you wish.

Call the function multiple times for multiple dice.
